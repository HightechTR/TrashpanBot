## Setting up in Intellij

Prerequisites: JDK 17, update Intellij to the most recent version.

1. Open Intellij (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project first)
2. Open the project into Intellij as follows:
   i. Click `Open`.
   ii. Select the project directory, and click `OK`.
   iii. If there are any further prompts, accept the defaults.
3. Configure the project to use **JDK 17** (not other versions) as explained in [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sdk.html#set-up-jdk).<br>
   In the same dialog, set the **Project language level** field to the `SDK default` option.
4. After that, locate the `src/main/java/TrashpanBot.java` file, right-click it, and choose `Run Duke.main()` (if the code editor is showing compile errors, try restarting the IDE). If the setup is correct, you should see something like the below as the output:
   ```

   Raah! I'm TrashpanBot!
   What can I do for you today?
   ```

**Warning:** Keep the `src\main\java` folder as the root folder for Java files (i.e., don't rename those folders or move Java files to another folder outside of this folder path), as this is the default location some tools (e.g., Gradle) expect to find Java files.

## Running the .jar file

Prerequisites: JDK 17

1. Download the latest .jar file from Releases.
2. Copy .jar file into any folder. This folder will serve as the home directory for the application.
3. Create a data folder in the home directory. This folder will store the save data from the application. The application will not run if you do not have this folder.
4. Open Terminal, cd into the home directory and run ```java -jar TrashpanBot.jar```
