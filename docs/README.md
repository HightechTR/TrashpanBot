TrashpanBot is an interactive task list manager.
It is able to store tasks of various types and has many functions to aid in managing tasks.
It can also save your tasks automatically and reload them.

It is optimised for a Command-Line Interface (CLI).

This bot is based on the personality of [Raki Kazuki](https://www.youtube.com/@RakiKazuki), a Virtual YouTuber formerly from
PixelLink.

## Quick Start

This section will guide you through first-time installation of TrashpanBot.

### **1. Check the Java version on your device**
This bot runs on the Java 17 JDK.

To check if you have Java installed on your device, open a Terminal window
and run the command: `java -version`

The output should appear like this:
```
java version "17.0.12" 2024-07-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 17.0.12+8-LTS-286)
```
Ensure the Java version listed begins with "17".

You may skip step 2 if you have Java 17 installed.

### **2. Install Java 17**

If you get an error or see a different version in the previous step,
Java 17 may not be installed.

You may download Java from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html).

**Installation Instructions:**
- For Windows Users

Any Windows installer will work, but the Windows x64 Installer is recommended for ease of use.

- For Mac Users

The DMG installer is recommended. However, please note down the CPU of your Mac.

Use the macOS x64 DMG Installer if your Mac has an Intel CPU, or the macOS Arm 64 DMG Installer if your Mac has an Apple M-series CPU.

- For Linux Users

Check instructions for your distribution as installation may differ between distros.

Generally, use the Debian Package for Debian-based distros (Ubuntu, Linux Mint) and the RPM Package for Red Hat-based distros (Fedora, CentOS).

### **3. Download the latest .jar file of TrashpanBot**

Download the latest .jar file release of TrashpanBot [here](https://github.com/HightechTR/ip/releases).

### **4. Place the .jar file in a desired home folder**

Move or copy the file to any desired folder on your computer.\
The folder it will be in will serve as the working home folder for TrashpanBot.

### **5. Run the application from the terminal**

Right-click an empty space in the home folder and select Open in Terminal.
Alternatively, you may open a Terminal window and `cd` into the home folder.

Run the command `java -jar TrashpanBot.jar` to start the application in the terminal.

home folder. This folder contains the save data for TrashpanBot.
Do not modify or delete this folder to prevent loss of save data.

## Features

### **Notes about the command format**

The command format for examples below will be displayed in a format
that resembles this:
```
deadline <description> /by <due>
```
Any component in angle brackets `<>` denote parameters. They must be defined when you run the command.

For example, in the command `todo <description>`, `<description>` is a parameter.
It may be used as `todo Read Book`.

Unless otherwise specified, parameters are accepted simply as strings or plain text with no specific format.

Components with a forward slash `/` separate different parts of some commands.
They must be included as-is when running the command.

For commands that do not take in parameters, such as `list`, any extraneous parameters added to
the command will be ignored.

### **Notes about Task Types and Format**

TrashpanBot can store three types of tasks: `todo`, `deadline` and `event`.

#### **Todo Task**
A `todo` is a task that only contains a description. It does not have any date attached to it.\
It is represented in the task list like this:
```
1.[T][ ] Example
```

#### **Deadline Task**
A `deadline` is a task that contains a description and a due date.\
It is represented in the task list like this:
```
1.[D][ ] Example (by: 12 June 2025 13:00)
```

#### **Event Task**
An `event` is a task that contains a description and two dates, a start and an end date.\
It is represented in the task list like this:
```
1.[E][ ] Example (from: 12 June 2025 13:00 to: 14 June 2025 15:00)
```

#### **Marked Tasks**
Tasks that are marked as done will have an additional `X` shown in the box next to the type icon:
```

If there is no save file (i.e. when the bot starts for the first time), this message is shown at startup:
```
Uh...I couldn't find a save file...
No worries, I'll create one for you!
```
TrashpanBot will automatically create the data folder and the save file.

#### **Loading an Existing Save File**
If there is a save file, it will begin loading it and will show this message:
```
Look, I found a save file!
Loading it for you...
```

If the load is successful, it will immediately start the program.

### **Editing the Save File**

TrashpanBot stores its save file in plaintext using a .txt file
in `[JAR file location]/data/TaskList.txt`.\
Advanced users may edit the save file directly.

> [!CAUTION]
> If your edits to the save file makes its format invalid, TrashpanBot will discard
> all data and start from a fresh save file.\
> If this occurs, this message will be shown after loading the save:
> ```
> Eh? Something's wrong with the save file, it's all gibberish!
> Here, I'll create a new one for you.
> ```
> It is recommended to back up the save file before editing it.
